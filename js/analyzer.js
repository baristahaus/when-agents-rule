// Transcript analyzer — read a finished match back, turn by turn.
//
// A transcript is the only artifact that survives a match, and until now reading
// one meant writing a script. This turns it into something you can scrub: the
// graph with a playhead, a list of every turn every seat took, and for each one
// what that model was told, what it decided, why it said it decided that, and
// what the harness answered.
//
// It renders ONLY what the file attests to. No interpolation between snapshots:
// they arrive 8 to 900 seconds apart depending on the seat, and units move ~3u/s,
// so a smooth animation would be inventing up to hundreds of units of travel per
// unit per frame. A frame here is a moment the transcript vouches for, and the
// gaps are left visible because they are part of what happened — a seat that was
// asked twelve times while another answered once is the story, not a rendering
// defect to smooth over.
