// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Match transcripts — the verbatim exchange with each model, for analysis.
//
// The decision log shows what a model DID. This records what it was SHOWN and
// what it SAID, unedited: the full state JSON it received, its reply, its
// reasoning where the provider exposes it, and the harness's answer. Enough to
// follow the back and forth turn by turn after the fact.
//
// Why not reuse controller.turnLog: that exists to replay cheap history back to
// the model, and is lossy by design — the reply is collapsed and cut to 600
// characters, it keeps content OR reasoning but never both, and its "user" is
// the COMPACT state rather than the full one the model actually saw.
//
// Storage is OPFS (origin-private files), measured at ~0.3ms per turn against
// an ~11GB quota, so recording every player of every match is free in practice.
// One append-only JSONL file per player: each line parses on its own, so a file
// truncated by a crash still yields every complete turn before it — which a
// single big JSON array would not.
//
// Lifetime is deliberately one match. The results screen offers the download and
// says the transcripts go when it closes; nothing accumulates on disk behind the
// user's back. purge() also runs at match START, because "Hauptmenü" reloads the
// page and an async delete cannot be relied on during unload.
