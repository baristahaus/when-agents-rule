// What a player actually compares is each preset against easy, so in those terms:
//   easy   = Summer Valley  392 food, 784 wood, 40 stone  (the baseline)
//   medium = Winter Valley  food x0.25                    (98 food)
//   hard   = Desert         food x0.125, wood x0.25, stone x0.5  (49 / 196 / 20)
// Gold has no entry and is deliberately identical in all three — 18 patches — so the
// scarcest resource is never what separates the presets.
// The setup screen derives its summary from this table rather than restating it, so
// changing a number here changes what the player is told.
