// ============================================================================
// The spectator DIRECTOR.
//
// The job is a match recorded end to end that nobody has to steer and nobody
// switches off: never a dead frame, never a missed fight.
//
// What was here before returned {x, z, zoom} every frame and the renderer eased
// toward it. Two things followed from that one shape, and they were the whole
// problem. There was no yaw and no pitch, so the angle never changed in a match
// — it read as one unbroken shot from one fixed compass bearing. And because
// every frame nudged toward the newest point, every change of subject was a PAN:
// crossing the map meant seconds of empty grass at constant speed. Dead air, on
// purpose, between everything worth seeing.
//
// So this chooses SHOTS. A shot is a subject, a pose, a motion and a duration,
// and it is held. Between shots we CUT — instant, free, and read as intent —
// while movement happens only INSIDE a shot, where it means something: tracking
// a marching army, easing in on a construction site.
//
// Three rules the rest follows from:
//
//   Cut between scenes, move within them.
//   Compose with depth — put something worth seeing BEYOND the subject.
//   Let rhythm follow tension: 3.5s in a brawl, 10s establishing a camp.
//
// Yaw snaps to eight compass angles. Free rotation frames each shot better and
// costs the viewer their sense of which way the board faces, which is exactly
// what a four-camp comparison needs. Eight is enough for every shot here to look
// distinct and few enough that the map still has a north.
//
// CAMERA CONVENTION, measured rather than assumed (dimetricView):
//   eye = target + dist * (sin yaw, cos yaw)
// so the camera LOOKS along -(sin yaw, cos yaw). Everything below composes with
// one helper, yawAlong(dx, dz) = atan2(-dx, -dz): "put the camera behind this
// vector and look up it." Behind a marching army, past a tower at what it is
// shooting, over a worker camp at the enemy town on the horizon — one rule, and
// behind a scout walking into fog it has not lifted yet.
