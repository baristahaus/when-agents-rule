// Rule-based AI for computer opponents.
//
// Design goals (rewrite):
//  - FAIR vs LLM players: the rule-based AI is fog-limited just like the models.
//    It only harvests resources it has DISCOVERED (vision), only attacks enemies
//    it can currently SEE (or remembered enemy buildings / always-visible wonders),
//    and must scout to find more. Age-ups and research run through the SAME timed
//    game systems the models/human use (no instant ages, no double-speed research).
//  - DEADLOCK-FREE: a single priority pass each think, every step gated by its own
//    affordability/availability check so nothing oscillates or spends into deficit.
//    Resources are never lost to a failed building placement (position is found
//    BEFORE spending). Workers never strand: they gather the most-needed known
//    resource, and a spare scout is sent out when something needed isn't discovered.
// A visibility test for ONE owner, built once for a BATCH of questions asked against a
// board that does not move while the batch runs (a single synchronous loop: every node
// on the map, every rival unit). The linear check scans every unit and building of the
// owner per question; discovery asks it for every node and every rival entity, several
// times a second, and it was 58% of the platform's headless CPU.
//
// Each eye (a unit or a finished building) is filed under every grid cell its sight
// disc can reach, padded by one unit so float rounding can never leave a cell out. A
// question then tests only the eyes filed under its own cell, with EXACTLY the original
// expression -- Math.hypot for AIManager.isVisibleTo, sqrt(dx*dx + dz*dz) for the
// harness's isPositionVisibleToAI -- and the same rules about dead units and
// construction sites, so every answer is bit-identical to the linear scan. Built per
// batch, never cached across one: nothing can move between build and use.
//
// `harness` selects WHICH predicate's rules apply: sqrt versus hypot, and construction
// sites skipped (harness) versus simply having a zero range (not). It does NOT select
// whether the dead may see. Neither predicate lets a corpse scout:
// AIManager.isVisibleTo never has, and isPositionVisibleToAI stopped since our 081dd22
// ("one question, one answer"). When the two halves of this fork met, the index was still
// filing a dead unit's sight disc in harness mode while the predicate had stopped trusting
// it, so the index claimed ground the model was then told it could not see -- the mismatch
// tests/vision-index.test.cjs exists to catch, and caught.

// Anchor tiers (review #7): the same brain in a few named styles, so a model can be
