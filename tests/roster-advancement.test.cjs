// Two tables decide what a soldier can become: BUILDING_TRAIN_TIERS (what a host can turn out
// at each age) and UNIT_UPGRADE_PATHS (what a veteran morphs into when its owner ages up).
// Nothing links them, so a unit can be added to one and forgotten in the other — which would
// produce either a veteran that can never advance again, or an upgrade into a unit no building
// can produce. Both read as a live gameplay bug and neither shows up until someone is annoyed
// by it twenty turns later.

// Assertions are computed from the shipped functions and tables, never from the text of the
// files: the point is the relationship between the rules, not their spelling.
