# 🏛️ When Agents Rule

### Where language models battle for the crown in antiquity.

**Up to four LLMs. One map. One winner.**
A browser-based, Age-of-Empires-style real-time strategy game in which competing language models play *against each other* — while you watch, coach, and score them.

## What is this?

A sandbox arena for pitting language models against one another at a task they were never trained for: running an economy and an army, in real time, inside a small RTS they've never seen. Every player is an autonomous model agent governing its own civilization, and every match ends one of two ways — a rival razed to the ground, or a Wonder held in peace.

This is an **agent harness** whose task happens to be a real-time strategy game. Every turn a model is handed a compact **JSON snapshot** of its situation (resources, buildings, units, fog-of-war discoveries, threats, tech tree, map bounds), **named command tools** — such as `move_units`, `attack_target` and `research_tech`, sharing a budget of three commands per turn — plus an independent `plan` tool to save its objective — and one instruction: **win.** Then it has to keep doing that, turn after turn, for a whole match.

The tools are real tool calls, extracted from the chat-completion response the same way OpenCode or any other agent harness extracts them. That matters for what a result means: a malformed call costs that call, not the turn, and a model gets the same per-call feedback it would get anywhere else it is deployed.

It's a hands-on testbed, not a benchmark — see [Disclaimers](#-disclaimers). With the setup held steady (same civilization, fixed map seed, resource layout equal for every player) a match isolates the model well enough for narrow comparisons.

## Why it's an interesting eval

Most quick LLM demos reward a single clever answer. A full match rewards the things people actually care about in agents:

- **🎯 Three actions a turn, and the turn will not wait.** The budget is the eval. A model does not get to do everything it can think of — it has to answer *what are the three most important things right now*, on a board that changes between its own calls. Lift the cap and the answer after a wipe is simply "rebuild all of it at once", which measures a bank balance rather than judgement.
- **⚔️ Models develop their own doctrine.** Same rules, same prompt — yet you get pure economists racing for a Wonder next to warlords massing an army absurdly early. Which one a model turns out to be is part of what you're measuring.
- **🧨 Pressure changes their play.** Raided, out-scouted, slipping down the leaderboard — many models genuinely switch tactics rather than doubling down. Watching one *notice* it is losing is worth the match on its own.
- **🎯 Precise tool calling.** Every move must be valid JSON — one action, or up to three in one reply. Hallucinate a tool, fumble the schema, wrap it in prose — the turn is wasted, and you can watch format discipline hold or crumble.
- **🧭 An unfamiliar framework.** No fine-tuning, no examples of good play. Only the rules in the prompt and the state in front of it.
- **🧠 Long-horizon strategy.** Economy → tech → military → conquest plays out over dozens of turns. Models that optimize forever and never build an army lose. The harness carries a model-authored **objective + plan** (up to 10 steps) across turns — but maintaining it is the model's job.
- **🔁 Error recovery.** A rejected action comes back with a precise reason. Does the model correct course, or bang on the same locked door?
- **🗺️ Spatial reasoning.** Fog of war hides the map; resources and enemies must be scouted before they can be used or attacked.
- **⏱️ Latency vs. quality.** In real-time mode faster models simply act more often, and a brilliant-but-slow model gets out-tempoed. Turn-based rounds remove that variable when you want to compare judgement instead.

## ✨ Features

**The match**
- **🤖 2–4 models, fighting live** — each with its own asynchronous decision pipeline.
- **⏳ Two tempos** — *real time*, where faster models act more often, or **turn-based rounds**: every seat reads the same snapshot, all moves land together, and a configurable answer time (default 90 s) keeps one slow endpoint from stalling the rest. Missed rounds are recorded rather than hidden.
- **⏱ Speed control** — 1× / 1.5× / 2× / 4×, plus **Pause** (which waits for answers already in flight, so no move is thrown away). Held at 1× while a Wonder stands, so the countdown can't be sped past.
- **🌱 Seeded maps & fair placement** — the same seed reproduces the exact layout; food and wood fill an even 7×7 grid while scarce **stone and gold are placed identically for every player**. The map stops being a confound.

- **🛡️ Persistent army orders** — march, scout without initiating combat, guard a position, or patrol between two points. Incoming damage triggers formation-wide retaliation, with towers first and bounded pursuit of mobile threats; survivors reform and resume their assignment, including priests in ranged slots. A new order replaces the selected units' previous assignment.
- **🌗 Day and night** — a cosmetic 12-minute cycle with warm dusk, cool nights, campfires and entrance lights. Simulation speed does not accelerate the lighting cycle.

**The models**
- **🔌 Bring any model** — OpenAI-compatible (OpenAI, vLLM, LM Studio, LiteLLM, Groq, OpenRouter, …), **Anthropic**, **Ollama**, **Google (Gemini)**, with auto-detection. Mix local and cloud in one match.
- **🔐 Every auth style** — none, API key (Bearer), header secret, Basic, or OAuth2.
- **🧰 Model library** — add, **test connection**, pick the served model, and set per-model **max tokens**, **context budget**, **language**, **temperature / top-p / top-k**, **thinking/reasoning** settings, and a raw request-body passthrough for anything newer than this harness. Connection, model/budgets, and collapsible advanced settings keep the basics together. Saved locally, exportable/importable.
- **🧠 Rolling context that scales with the model** — history is sized to each model's context budget, so a 128K model remembers more of the match than a 32K one. Default is a real multi-turn conversation; a **minimize-tokens** toggle switches to compact one-line history.
- **🪙 Token accounting** — provider-reported prompt + completion usage per model, next to latency.

**Watching & reading it back**
- **🛰️ Live spectator dashboard** — ranked leaderboard, streaming **decision log** (every move plus the model's stated reason, rejections flagged), per-model **advice chat**, and play/pause per model. Collapse the decisions panel to the latest turn’s command headlines for each seat.
- **🏛️ Antiquity visual milestone** — warm directional light, cast shadows, irregular coastal water reflections, sculpted miniature units with cultural facial hair, angled handheld equipment and proportionate horses, continuous tree crowns, layered meadow/snow/sand surfaces with close-up ground detail, refined Greek architecture and camera controls integrated with the minimap. Arena configuration and the model library share the charcoal/bronze theme. Try **Explore civilizations** locally: choose civilization, summer/winter/desert, Stone through Iron Age, and time of day. Iron Age includes the civilization's Wonder; **Inspect workers** gives a close-up. Direct links: `/?showcase=1&civ=greek` (also `egyptian`, `yamato`, `persian`). The live transcript uses eight-turn pages to keep long matches responsive. [Scope, graphics settings and verification](docs/VISUAL_MILESTONE.md).
- **🎬 A battlefield worth watching** — feathered fog of war, arrows and tower stones, hit flashes, animated deaths, battle pings, per-map ground cover, and an optional **action camera** that follows the fighting.
- **📊 End-of-match evaluation** — latency, decisions, action-success rate, format fidelity, reasoning rate, error breakdown, behavior tags, and a transparent 0–100 strategy score.
- **📄 Exports** — the evaluation as a self-describing `results_<datetime>.md`, and the full **transcript** as JSONL: every state sent, every reply, every harness answer, with the results and the economy timeline appended at the end.
- **🎞️ [Analyze Transcript](#-analyze-transcript)** — load a saved transcript and read a finished match back, turn by turn, in the same 3D engine.
- **🌍 Fully localized UI** — English, German, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, with the *model's* language chosen separately from the interface language.
- **⌨️ Reading and navigation** — keyboard-accessible mode selection and modal dialogs, selectable transcript text, readable model names, and reduced interface motion when requested by your device settings.

**The rest**
- **🌙 Keeps running in a background tab** — a Web-Worker driver keeps the simulation and the models' turns going while the tab is hidden.
- **🎮 Also human-playable** — a **Campaign** mode: pick your civilization and face 1–5 opponents, model- or AI-controlled, on three maps. If a model's endpoint dies mid-game that opponent falls back to the rule-based AI.
- **🚫 No build step, no dependencies** — plain HTML/CSS/JS with an in-house WebGL engine; every texture painted procedurally at load. No CDN, no assets, no external code.

## 🚀 Quick start

No install, no bundler. Serve the folder over HTTP (the app uses `fetch`, so `file://` won't work).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asp67/when-agents-rule.git
cd when-agents-rule

# pick any static server:
npx http-server . -p 8080 -o          # Node
# python3 -m http.server 8080         # Python
# php -S localhost:8080               # PHP
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** and click **Play → 🏟️ Arena**.

> 💡 **Fastest path to a match:** install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), pull something small and quick (`ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`), and point a couple of seats at `http://localhost:11434`. Small + fast beats large + slow in a real-time arena.
>
> 🐦 **Easy first pick:** `ollama pull ornith:9b` — ~6 GB of VRAM, runs on many consumer cards, and a surprisingly strong player for its size.

## 🏟️ Setting up the Arena

1. **Model Library** → add your models. Set the **endpoint**, pick the **provider** (or leave on auto-detect), choose **auth**, hit **🔌 Test connection**, select the served model. Optionally set max tokens, context budget, language, and sampling/thinking parameters.
2. **Arena participants** → choose **2–4 seats**, then give each a **civilization** and a **controller**. Set the **difficulty**, an optional **map seed**, and whether to run **turn-based rounds** (with the answer time per round).
3. **System prompt** → tweak the shared template, or give individual seats their own.
4. **⚔️ Start Arena** and watch.

<div align="center">

![Current model library and connection settings](Screenshots/ModelLibrary.png)

<sub><i>The current model library: configure a provider, connection and model settings. Fresh browser profile; no credentials or private endpoints shown.</i></sub>

</div>

While spectating you can **click a card** to fly the camera to that base, **drag** to pan, send a model **advice**, or **pause** one entirely. The decision log streams every move with the model's own reason, and flags rejections:

| Input | Spectator / replay | Campaign |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left click / tap | Inspect a unit or building | Select a unit or building |
| Left mouse drag | Pan map; no box selection | Box-select units |
| Right mouse drag | Read coordinates while held | Pan map; releasing a drag issues no order |
| Right click | Coordinate flag | Move, attack, repair or confirm placement |
| One-finger drag / pinch | Pan / zoom | Pan / zoom |
| Touch and hold | Coordinate flag | Hold still, then release to issue an order |

For left-button-only campaign navigation, open the minimap's camera-options chevron and enable the **hand tool**. Switch it off to restore mouse box selection. Touch always uses one-finger panning. Moving after a hold, adding another finger or cancelling the gesture discards the pending touch order. The in-game controls card describes these bindings in all four UI languages.

<sub><i>A Greek village at ground level: troops gather beside the watchtower while workers move among homes, the temple and the town center.</i></sub>

</div>

> 💡 **The context budget is a real lever.** Default **32768** tokens; **↺ Max** fills in the model's true maximum. History is sized to it, in one of two modes: **multi-turn** (past turns replayed as compact state recaps plus the model's replies — richest memory) or **minimize tokens** (each past move as one line — cheapest, still coherent). Either way the prompt is rebuilt from scratch every turn, and if an endpoint rejects a request as too large the harness shrinks the window and keeps playing.
>
> **Lower budgets are much faster** — on Ollama the budget also sets `num_ctx`, and an oversized window can spill the model onto the CPU. For small local models 32K is a good default. If a model overthinks, raise its **max tokens** (the *output* budget), not its context, so it can finish reasoning *and* still emit the JSON action.

## 🔧 Tool calls, and which stack served them

Models act by calling tools, on all four protocols — OpenAI-compatible (vLLM, llama.cpp, LM Studio, OpenRouter, Groq …), Ollama, Anthropic and Google. Named game-command tools share one definition translated into each dialect. Up to three game commands run in order per turn, plus one independent `plan` call when the objective or plan changes. A plan-only reply is a successful plan update; saved plan steps are not automatically executed.

**A seat that cannot work the tools fails visibly.** That is the point rather than a rough edge: a harness that quietly compensates for a broken tool-call parser hides the one thing its operator needs to know. When no call arrives the error says *which* fault it is — tool syntax found in the raw reply means the model called and the server missed it (a wrong `--tool-call-parser` on vLLM, a chat template without a tool section on llama.cpp), and no syntax means the model simply did not call.

For older or smaller models, and for endpoints whose parser or template is broken, each seat has an **Accept inline JSON** switch. Off by default. Switching it on is a declaration, not a convenience — it is recorded in the transcript, because a seat allowed to fall back is scored on a softer contract than one that is not, and every turn records whether it was answered by `tool_call` or by `content`.

**A result belongs to a model *and* a stack.** A model that works through Ollama and fails through OpenRouter is one of the most useful things this can tell you, so every seat records `servedBy` — what the server calls itself (`vllm`, `llamacpp`, `ollama`, …), asked once at match start and never guessed from the endpoint, which is deliberately not stored. Read a number as *(model × stack × settings)*; a bare per-model figure is not reproducible.

> 💡 **On llama.cpp, set `--reasoning-format deepseek`.** The default is `auto`, and `auto` drops the reasoning trace as soon as it delivers tool calls — the tokens are billed, the thinking is gone, and the transcript shows an empty Reasoning panel on exactly the turns that went best. Set explicitly, the trace arrives alongside the calls and you can read along while the model thinks. (`deepseek-legacy` also leaves `<think>` tags in the content, which is harmless here because content is not evaluated when tool calls arrive.)

## 🎞️ Analyze Transcript

A third mode beside Arena and Campaign, and the other half of the round trip: a match records itself, gets downloaded, gets handed to someone else — and opens here.

<div align="center">

![Reading a finished match back in the analyzer](Screenshots/AnalyzeTranscript.png)

<sub><i>Episode 6 reopened in build 819: an existing recorded match rendered with the current engine, with the turn list, saved plan and economy graph. The header retains the original recording's build and prompt version.</i></sub>

</div>

Load a `match-*.jsonl` and you get:

- **The board in the real engine.** The arena's own renderer with the full camera — pan, rotate, zoom. The map is rebuilt exactly from the recorded seed, and **fog is per seat**: only what that model had discovered is lit, with opacity scaled to how much of each tile it swept. Switch to **All seats** for the cumulated view, where ground nobody ever scouted stays dark.
- **What the model was thinking.** Its standing objective and plan (carried forward, and flagged on the turns it rewrote them), the command it sent, its stated reason, its raw reasoning, and the harness's answer.
- **A timeline you can scrub.** Step through turns, **play** at 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 entries a second through the filtered list, use the all-entry slider, click the economy graph to jump, or use the chapter list — age advances, wonders, exhausted resources, combat. Filters narrow it to combat, harness errors, plan rewrites or missed rounds.
- **Saved reading views.** Choose Balanced, Watch, Read, or Compare, adjust the map height with the divider (drag or arrow keys), and choose comfortable or compact text. These preferences and playback rate stay in this browser, separately from exported match/model settings.
- **Visible camera controls.** Open Camera for a whole-map overview, selection focus, reset, zoom, and rotation. Manual camera input turns automatic following off. These controls are also available in live play.
- **Click anything** to inspect it. Remembered enemy positions render translucent and say when they were last seen, so a stale sighting never looks like a live one.

**Seven real matches ship with the game**, in `samples/`, with every plan, command and reasoning block in them. No key, no endpoint, nothing to configure: the analyzer only ever reads a file. `samples/index.json` lists them with their models, tempo and result.

Direct match links open the viewer with a specific catalogue entry loaded: [Episode 6](https://asp67.github.io/when-agents-rule/?match=match-20260907-120324) and [Episode 7](https://asp67.github.io/when-agents-rule/?match=match-20260909-211941). Use `?match=` followed by the entry's `matchId`; unknown IDs show a loading error rather than a different match.

- `2026-07-26_opus5-grok4.5-gpt-oss_36min.jsonl` — 271 turns, **turn-based** (60 s a round). Opus 5 as Persia, Grok 4.5 as Egypt, and gpt-oss on a single consumer GPU as Yamato. Opus 5 wins.
- `2026-08-09_kimi-k3-gemma4-qwen3.8-ornith9b_25min.jsonl` — 490 turns, **real time**, nobody waiting for anybody. Kimi K3 as Yamato, a local Gemma 4 26B as the Greeks, Qwen 3.8 Max as Persia, and a 9B quant on a desktop GPU as Egypt. Kimi K3 wins, having issued three commands a turn to the others' one.
- `2026-08-11_muse-glimmer-qwen3.6-gemma4_88min.jsonl` — 484 turns, **real time**, and the longest of the three-player games. Muse-Glimmer 30B as the Greeks, Gemma 4 31B as Egypt, Qwen 3.6 27B as Persia. Persia wins on 3039 power against 164 and 117.
- `2026-08-17_qwen3.8-opus4.6-qwen3.6-muse-glimmer_125min.jsonl` — 544 turns over two hours, **turn-based** (120 s a round), four seats. Qwen 3.8 27B as Yamato, Claude Opus 4.6 as Egypt, Qwen 3.6 27B as Persia, Muse-Glimmer 30B as the Greeks. Yamato finishes last one standing on 4617 power; Egypt finishes fourth on 129, its town centre destroyed and its last recorded thought reading “Need food desperately.” The 27B open model beats the frontier model on this board — one board, one seed, not a verdict.
- `2026-08-26_deepseek-v4-glm5.3-qwen3.8-gpt5.6_103min.jsonl` — 389 turns, **turn-based** (150 s a round), four seats, and the one where a Wonder nearly changed the result. deepseek-v4-flash as Persia, glm-5.3-flash as the Greeks, Qwen3.8 27B running locally as Egypt, gpt-5.6-luna as Yamato. Persia commits to the Iron Age at 38:32 while everyone else is still in Bronze, then trains champions and nothing else for forty minutes. Greece pays everything it has for a Wonder at 75:00 — hold it 600 seconds and the match is yours — and loses it after **154**. Egypt is eliminated with 10,070 food and zero workers left to spend it.

- `2026-09-07_gemini-flash-deepseek-v4-gpt5.6-qwen3.8_89min.jsonl` — Episode 6, **The Architect in the Ashes**: 427 turns over 89:50, **turn-based** (120 s a round). Gemini Flash as Egypt, DeepSeek v4 Flash as the Greeks, GPT 5.6 Luna as Persia, and Qwen3.8 Flash as Yamato. The full transcript includes the capital raid, the search for stone, the Wonder defense and all four models' closing statements.

- `2026-09-09_gemini3.8-deepseek-v4-gpt5.6-qwen3.8_121min.jsonl` — Episode 7, **The Cartographers and the Procession**: 723 turns over 121:23, **turn-based** (180 s rounds), on a snow map. Gemini 3.8 Flash as Egypt, DeepSeek v4 Flash Pro as the Greeks, GPT 5.6 Luna as Persia, and local Qwen3.8 Flash Next as Yamato. The transcript follows worker travel calculations, the marching armies, the Wonder countdown and the search for the last town centre, with all four closing statements.

Nothing is interpolated between snapshots. Replay also bypasses live positional separation, so recorded units stay at their recorded coordinates. They arrive seconds to minutes apart depending on the seat, so every frame is a moment the file actually attests to — and each turn shows how stale the other seats' pictures are.

## 🧮 How a model is scored

The **Strategy Score** (0–100) is a transparent composite — no black box:

| Weight | Factor |
|:---:|---|
| 34% | Action success rate (valid, accepted moves) |
| 20% | Progression (age advanced · buildings · military) |
| 18% | Format fidelity (well-formed JSON the engine could parse) |
| 15% | Reliability (no timeouts / network errors) |
| 13% | Action diversity (used the toolset, didn't loop one move) |

Alongside it: latency, decisions made, success ratio, reasoning rate, token usage, and a full error breakdown — timeouts, parse fails, **no-action replies** (prose with no JSON action; nothing is guessed or executed), invalid actions, rejections, context overflows, rate limits, and missed rounds. Costs the harness caused are counted but kept out of the model's reliability score, so a rate limit or a round deadline never reads as an unreachable endpoint.

## 🛠️ How it works

```
Browser (no backend, no external code)
├── In-house engine (js/engine) — WebGL: locked dimetric camera, procedural textures,
│                                 composed meshes, fog plane, effects
├── Game engine               — economy, combat, fog of war, ages, win conditions
├── Provider adapters         — OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama / Google request shaping + auth
└── Per-model agent loop      — builds the JSON game-state, calls the model, parses its
                                command(s), applies them in order, feeds each result back
```

Each turn a model receives a structured snapshot and returns an action:

```json
{ "action": "build_structure", "params": { "buildingType": "barracks", "reason": "need infantry to pressure the leader" } }
```

**Or up to three commands in one reply.** The game does not stop while a model thinks — in a
recent match the slowest seat sat 43 seconds between turns, so its orders landed on a board
43 seconds older than the one it read. A short queue lets a slow seat spend one turn on a
whole beat of play instead of three stale ones:

```json
{ "commands": [
    { "action": "train_unit",      "params": { "unitType": "worker" } },
    { "action": "build_structure", "params": { "buildingType": "house" } },
    { "action": "explore",         "params": { "tile": "C5" } } ],
  "objective": "out-expand the leader" }
```

It is entirely optional — a single action is a complete reply, and a lone `wait` is as valid as
three orders. Commands run **in order against a board each one changes**, and the model cannot
look between them, so spending resources early can get a later command refused for what the
first just used. Each is judged **on its own**: one refusal does not cancel its siblings, and
the feedback names which number failed and why. A reply whose JSON is broken still costs the
whole turn — so the penalty for malformed output scales with how much was riding on it,
without any special rule. The results screen reports **commands per turn** beside the success
rate rather than inside it, so a seat that sends one safe command cannot outrank one that sends
three and gets two right.

The engine validates it against the **advancement chain** (advance → research → build → resources → train) and returns a precise, actionable error if it can't be done — which becomes part of the model's context next turn. The full state contract is in [`game-state-schema.json`](game-state-schema.json).

**The harness never plans for the model.** Every turn the prompt is rebuilt from scratch, so the harness — not each server's truncation rules — decides exactly what the model sees. The model always gets the outcome of every command it last sent, each numbered and answered separately (a rejected command is never silently repeated), the current state last, and its own standing objective and plan echoed back until it rewrites them. Everything else is the model's own reasoning.

**Action set:** `train_unit` · `research_tech` · `upgrade_age` · `build_structure` · `assign_workers` · `repair_building` · `explore` · `move_units` · `attack_target` · `delete_unit` · `destroy_building` · `wait`. Villagers and the Wonder are ordinary targets: `train_unit` with `unitType: "worker"`, and `build_structure` with the civ's Wonder id.

## ⚔️ Game rules in a nutshell

- **Win** by eliminating every rival, **or** building a **Wonder** and holding it for **600 s**. A rival is only out with no army, no military building it can afford to produce from, and no Town Center (nor a worker plus the resources to rebuild one) — so raze the base *and* mop up.
- **Advance the ages** — Stone → Neolithic → Bronze → Iron — for stronger units, tech and eventually the Wonder. Buildings take an epoch-appropriate look and +50% HP per age.
- **Economy first, but not forever.** Workers gather food/wood/stone/gold; houses raise the population cap (hard cap 100). **Nodes deplete** and disappear (food 500 · wood 300 · stone 1000 · gold 2000) — scout for fresh ones. Only farms regenerate, and only while manned.
- **Counters:** cavalry > ranged > infantry > cavalry; infantry raze buildings best; towers defend.
- **Fog of war:** a model can't harvest or attack what it hasn't discovered.
- **4 civilizations** — Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Yamato — each with a unique bonus and Wonder.

## 🔒 Privacy & security

Fully client-side, with no backend of its own.

- API keys live in your browser's **`localStorage`** and are sent **directly** to the endpoints you configure — nothing is proxied.
- Fine for local, single-user testing. Don't enter credentials on a shared machine, and scope any keys you use.
- **A copy served from anywhere but your own machine opens as a showcase**: straight into the analyzer with the bundled match, and no route to the Arena, the Campaign or the model catalogue. Those are the parts that ask for keys — and a key pasted into a page someone else controls is a different proposition from one pasted into a page you are serving yourself, even though both only ever keep it in your own browser. Append `?full=1` if you are deliberately self-hosting rather than just visiting.
- **Exporting** the model catalogue writes your keys **in plain text** (the app warns you). Keep that file private. Transcripts and results files are deliberately **key-free and endpoint-free**, so they're safe to hand on.

Plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript, nothing else. The 3D world is drawn by the in-house engine in `js/engine/`: a locked dimetric camera, every material painted procedurally into canvases at load, meshes composed from primitives. No framework, no bundler, no transpile, no CDN. Cache-busting is a `?v=` query on each script tag.

## 🧭 Related projects

Similar arenas, different games — worth knowing, and worth crediting:

- **[llm-colosseum](https://github.com/OpenGenerativeAI/llm-colosseum)** — the project that popularized LLM-vs-LLM gaming, in *Street Fighter III*, at reflex scale. This is the opposite end: long-horizon statecraft over half an hour, with a peaceful road to victory beside the military one.
- **[LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai)** — humans vote on chat answers. Here nobody votes; the game is the judge.
- **[Stratagem](https://github.com/KaliBomaye/stratagem)** — turn-based LLM strategy with natural-language diplomacy on a province graph. Ours is real-time, 3D, browser-only, and instruments every model as it plays.
- **[Age of Agents](https://github.com/agentsmill/age-of-agents)** — renders your AI *coding* sessions as a peaceful AoE-style kingdom. Here the agents don't decorate the kingdom, they run it.
- **[LLM-Game-Benchmark](https://github.com/research-outcome/LLM-Game-Benchmark)** — an academic benchmark across grid games, with a leaderboard. We trade rigor for richness: one sprawling, unfamiliar game instead of many small ones.

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

- **Non-scientific.** Not a peer-reviewed benchmark, and no single match is evidence of anything — sample sizes are tiny and tempo heavily influences who wins. Don't cite match results as model capability. Within a controlled setup (same civilization, fixed seed, equal resource layout, and turn-based rounds to neutralize speed) a match does isolate the model as the main variable and gives a genuine but narrow comparative read. Treat it as informed intuition, not data.
- **Not affiliated** with LMSYS / Chatbot Arena, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any model provider. "When Agents Rule" is meant literally: autonomous model agents governing rival civilizations — by wonder or by war.
- Built as a hobby project, with a generous assist from AI pair-programming.

Issues and PRs welcome — new providers, civilizations, balance tweaks, better metrics, or translations. Keep it dependency-free and build-step-free where possible.

### Running the tests

`npm test` — 308 tests, Node only, nothing to install. The suite loads the real `js/` files into a
`node:vm` sandbox and drives the actual methods, so it covers the simulation and the
harness rather than the shape of their own source text.

`npm run test:browser` — two optional Playwright suites: a visual one (lantern light
falloff, fog/ghost/quality rules, research progress, rejection warnings, transcript
replay) and one for the trust boundaries (showcase-mode gating, a hostile `/models`
response from an endpoint, a hostile transcript file opened in the analyzer). Playwright is
deliberately **not** a dependency here — the game has to stay runnable straight from a
folder — so point the suites at an existing install:

    WAR_PLAYWRIGHT_PATH=/path/to/node_modules/playwright npm run test:browser
